		<h2>Tonguing Fun</h2>
		<p>Tonguing is central to every wind-players tool kit, and as the tongue is a flexible and versatile muscle let’s find some fun ways to exercise and refine its skill.</p>
		<p>One game many will know is saying tongue twisters. Try your tongue with these, but keep it fun and light. We don’t want to strain the tongue (or your brain), but rather unlock its flexibility and quick-witted movements for your musical play. Here are some fun tongue twisters to limber up your tongue. Do you know any others that will help support your musical skills?</p>
		<p>Train your ‘t’ &amp; ‘d’ (single tonguing):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Mr.Tongue Twister tried to train his tongue to twist and turn, and twit an twat, to learn the letter ‘T’.</li>
			<li>How much dew could a dewdrop drop if a dewdrop did drop dew?</li>
			<li>Don’t trouble trouble, until trouble troubles you! If you trouble trouble, triple trouble troubles you!</li>
			<li>Tito and Tato were tattooed in total, But Toto was only tattooed on his toe, So Tato told Tito where Toto was tattooed, But Tito said Toto's tattoo wouldn't show.</li>
			<li>A Tudor who tooted the flute tried to tutor two tooters to toot. Said the two to  the tutor, "Is it harder to toot or to tutor two tooters to toot?"</li>
			<li>When a doctor gets sick and another doctor doctors him, does the doctor doing the doctoring have to doctor the doctor the way the doctor being doctored wants to be doctored, or does the doctor doing the doctoring of the doctor doctor the doctor as he wants to do the doctoring?</li>
			<li>A twister of twists once twisted a twist. And the twist that he twisted was a three-twisted twist. Now in twisting this twist, if a twist should untwist, would the twist that untwisted untwist the twists?</li>
			<li>Terry Teeter, a teeter-totter teacher, taught her daughter Tara to teeter-totter, but Tara Teeter didn't teeter-totter as Terry Teeter taught her to.</li>
			<li>Dick had a dog, the dog dug, the dog dug deep, how deep did Dick’s dog dig? Dick had a duck, the duck dived, the duck dived deep, how deep did Dick’s duck dive? Dick’s duck dived as deep as Dick’s dog dug!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Train your ‘k’ &amp; ‘g‘ (preparation for double tonguing):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Can you can a can as a canner can a can?</li>
			<li>How can a clam cram in a clean cream can?</li>
			<li>The girl gargoyle gave greek grapes to the guy gargoyle.</li>
			<li>A cunning young canner from Canning, Once observed to his granny, “A canner can can, a lot of things gran, But a canner can’t can a can, can he?”</li>
			<li>Grandma Gabby Grammer grabbed a gram of gummy goulash. If Grandma Gabby Grammer grabbed a gram of gummy goulash, How many grams of gummy goulash did Grandma Gabby Grammer grab?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Combine your ‘t’/‘d’ &amp; ‘k’/‘g’ (Double &amp; triple tonguing):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If Kantie can tie a tie and untie a tie, why can't I tie a tie and untie a tie like Kantie can.</li>
			<li>Giddy kiddy goat, Giddy kiddy goat, Giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, kiddy goat.</li>
			<li>Cook "Cookie" Turk took Kookie Kirk a turkey cookie.</li>
			<li>Tell Tom the ticket taker to take the ticket to the ticket wicket.</li>
		</ul>
