		<h2>Relaxed Breathing</h2>

		<p>Even a non-wind player can gain a lot from breath work. Breathing deeply and calmly is an awesome tool when nervous or stressed. Plus, conscious breathing helps string, keyboard and other players to support your musical phrasing and keep your body relaxed.</p>
		<p>Stand or sit in a relaxed way. Keep your joints soft and unlocked. Let your spine rise out of your pelvis (hip area), by imagining the prominent (the bump where neck and back meet) striving upwards. Let your arms and ribcage hang off of your prominent and your neck and head grow up from it like a flower.</p>
		<p>Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. As you breathe in encourage your chest to remain relaxed and unmoving (blue arrow) whilst your belly expands like a balloon (green arrow). Your hands will help you monitor this.</p>
		<p>Watch your breath and try to balance the in- and outbreath. I.e find a comfortable rhythm where both in- and outbreath take the same amount of time, without straining or holding your breath.</p>
		<p>Whilst maintaining this, allow your breath to slow and soften as if you are sniffing a flower.</p>
		<p>As you grow accustomed to breathing into your belly, remove your hands and see if you can uphold this breathing with ease. Place your hands on your sides or even on your lower back alongside your spine to explore how your breath opens up your belly to all sides.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Practise for a short time or longer periods of time … standing, sitting or even lying down …</li>
			<li>take a few of these breaths before you start to play a piece …</li>
			<li>use this technique when you're nervous or emotional …</li>
