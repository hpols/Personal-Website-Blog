		<h2>Exploring Your Breathing</h2>
		<p>Breathing and airflow is the core nourishment to any singer’s or wind player’s tone. But even if your instrument creates its sound without your breathe, it is still great to explore breathing for when you want to announce what you are playing to your audience, or find yourself singing along.</p>
		<p>The ideal is to have a constantly controlled flow of air. You already do this when you speak, but let us refine and improve your technique. Review our post on <a href="../relaxed_breathing.html">relaxed breathing</a>, which offers a great foundation to build on.</p>
		<h3>Exploring the breathing muscles</h3>
		  <p>Have you ever watched a dog pant? If you look closely you'll notice that their belly moves with each breath. If you are friendly with a dog you can also explore this as you pet them. Lay a hand on their belly (even when they are not panting) or just feel their breathing motions as you softly pet their flanks, belly and chest. This of course also works with cats you are friendly with.</p>

		<p>We all breathed like that when we were small, but many of us lose it to some degree through long hours of sitting, developing postural habits and so on. But this means we can rediscover this with ease.</p>
		<p>So let’s be silly and pant like a dog. Enjoy some fun with friends and family playing dog and get each other laughing. Or if you’re alone, you can let your inner dog out and make yourself laugh. Laughter by the way is another great way to rediscover those muscles!</p>
		<p class="quote">Don’t strain. Keep your breathing light and with the feeling that you could also take in even more air if needed. It should be comfortable.</p>
		<h3>Swim Ring Fun</h3>
		<p>Become human again ;), but continue to breath from your belly. Breathe into your belly and envision your breath is inflating a swim ring snuggly sitting around your waist. With your imaginary swim ring inflated let out a “shhh!”, “sss!” or a “fffff!” and imagine the ring slowly deflating gradually from all sides. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>How steady and long can you make the sound?</li>
				<li>Can you maintain the controlled pressure when you make the sound louder, softer or increase/decrease the volume as you empty your lungs?</li>
				<li>Which sound is easiest? Try and get all sounds equally comfortable.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Breathing Trampoline</h3>
		<p>Breathe into your belly again allowing it fill as before. This time imagine your midriff /diaphragm (these are muscles that close off the bottom of your rib cage) as a big springy trampoline. Say "ha! ha! ha!" and allow your belly to jump with each "ha!". t should not collapse, but be springy and each time return to it's swim ring feel. Each "ha!" is jumping on your trampoline deep within you.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Change the vowel and experiment with “ha”, “he”, “hi” and so on.</li>
				<li>Change the consonant and let them bounce, too, with a vowel of choice: p, t, k, b, d, g.</li>
				<li>Keep it steady and explore with different ryhthms.</li>
				<li>Start slowly and then pick up speed. </li>
			</ul>
		<p>You will notice that at some point you cannot bounce each syllable anymore due to the speed. Reduce the motion until you get a smooth and steady “support”, like a sprung dance floor ready for your musical notes to dance and jump on.</p>
		<p>Do you know <em>The Magic Flute</em> by W. A. Mozart? There is a wonderful duet in there where you can hear and watch trampolining syllables. You don't need to know the exact words or melody to imitate it.</p>

		<p>As you go back to your instrument try and use the idea of the swim ring and trampoline, individually and in unison. In time this kind of breathing and playing will become second nature to you, as you build on it and go deeper and deeper into your breath work.</p>
